* The challenge: create a dashboard I can use every day to update quarterly,
  weekly and daily goals (and archive past goals) and quickly get the weather, view something beautiful, think something inspiring, and (later in the day)
  get a TED talk fix.

* The solution: A database-powered dashboard with external links

* Features:
    * All-in-one page with locations for
        * Quarterly goals
        * Weekly goals
        * Daily goals
        * video player for TED talks
        * links to weather, Unsplash( for beauty) and my Inspire app for inspiration
    * Forms to add goals
    * Archive pages for past goals

* Technology: Ruby on Rails with 3 models, databases, and views, HTML, CSS, Google Fonts,
  FontSquirrel, Bootstrap, SimpleForm.
